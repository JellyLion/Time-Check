Have you wondered where did your time go? Time checker sents notifications every given time
which tell you the current hour and day (maybe) and you can write a note about what were you
doing at that time, so you can check it later. You can also specify a message in the notification
about what should you be doing at that time.

I have used some assets (like icons and buttons) from mad-cookies-studio/mad-productivity.
Although I'm using their design for referency, i'm writting my own code from scratch 
(my app uses gdscript 2.0 so i had to change things anyway.)
